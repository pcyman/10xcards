## Project Overview

### Target Audience

People who want to learn new things but lack the knowledge or time to create effective flashcards manually.

### Core Features

- **AI-Powered Flashcard Generation**: Paste your study material (1,000-10,000 characters) and let AI generate flashcard candidates
- **Manual Flashcard Creation**: Create flashcards manually for supplemental content
- **Deck Organization**: Organize flashcards by topic or subject using deck-based system
- **Spaced Repetition Study**: Review flashcards using open-source spaced repetition algorithms
- **User Authentication**: Simple username/password authentication system
- **Complete Flashcard Management**: Create, view, edit, and delete flashcards with full lifecycle control

### Success Metrics

The MVP aims to achieve:
- **75% AI Flashcard Acceptance Rate**: Percentage of AI-generated flashcards that users accept
- **75% AI Usage Rate**: Percentage of total flashcards created using AI generation

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Astro 5**: Modern web framework with server-side rendering (SSR mode)
- **React 19**: UI library for interactive components
- **TypeScript 5**: Type-safe JavaScript with strict configuration
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Utility-first CSS framework with CSS variables
- **Shadcn/ui**: Accessible component library (New York style, neutral base color)

### Backend

- **Supabase**: Comprehensive backend solution providing:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Backend-as-a-Service SDKs
  - Built-in user authentication
  - Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation
  - Open-source solution with local/self-hosting options

### AI Integration

- **OpenRouter.ai**: Access to multiple AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others) for:
  - High efficiency and low costs
  - Financial limits on API keys
  - Flexible model selection

### CI/CD and Hosting

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipelines
- **DigitalOcean**: Application hosting via Docker images

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v22.14.0 (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- **npm**: Latest version compatible with Node.js 22.14.0

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/10xcards.git
   cd 10xcards
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env` with your configuration:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `SUPABASE_KEY`: Your Supabase anon/public key
   - Additional AI service credentials as needed

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Available Scripts

### Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server on port 3000
npm run preview      # Preview production build locally
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build        # Build for production
```

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint         # Run ESLint to check for issues
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky and lint-staged to automatically run linters on staged files before commits:
- TypeScript, TSX, and Astro files: ESLint with auto-fix
- JSON, CSS, and Markdown files: Prettier formatting
